# GrayhawkInitiative

This is my first Foundry VTT macro or module.

The goal is to create a way to use the Grayhawk Initiative for a D&D 5e game in Foundry VTT

I had a macro that worked in 7.10, but not in 8.8 - so this is my effort to address that.
I also have a macro that is supposed to end the round and clear everything off - it never worked quite right.
